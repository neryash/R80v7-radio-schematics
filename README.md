# R80v7-radio-schematics
Schematics and build instructions for the R80v7 radio, new v7 version.

# This is for open use for anyone who wants to build the R80 v7 radio.
I only found v6 schematics available online, so I had to upload it.

*Translations
This version is in chinese although the schematic could be understood by anyone, translations will be gladly taken in with a PR.



**I am not viable for any damage done by using this schematic, this is just the one I got from my supplier
